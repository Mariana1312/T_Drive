T-Drive

This application is built on React JS (FE) and Python (BE).

Application installation instructions:
1. Run "npm install"
2. Run "npm start"
3. Browse to "http://localhost:3000".

Current Version:
* Upon adding a note, the data is not saved on server side, but a CSV copy with the updated data is being downloaded to the computer.
* Search Ability by Driver ID.
* "Add note" feature is live - Ability to add note for each row on the table.

Future Version:
* Fix "add note" behaviour, in which updating a note saves the updated data on server side.
* Redesign Application UI/UX to be user friendly and easy on the eye.
* Implement Product feature: Create a fifth column called rides. This column allows us to group data points of the same ride into a single entity.
